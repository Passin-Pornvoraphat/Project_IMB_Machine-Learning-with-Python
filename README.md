# Project_IMB_Machine-Learning-with-Python
This is my project for Machine Learning with Python Coursera Class created by IBM
I support to use IBM Watson Studio But, I don't know what wrong with server (26-Apr-2021) 
I got "500 Internal Server ErrorAn internal error occurred while serving your request" while trying to access.
So I sent Github link instant.
